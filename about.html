        <h1>About Us </h1>
        <p>"Education for All" is a nonprofit organization founded by two high school students, Brook and Netanya. They recognized a fundamental flaw in our country's educational system: the learning methodology. This issue was starkly illustrated by the national exam scores, which boasted a mere 3% passing rate. In response, Brook and Netanya took initiative on a modest scale by creating a platform where knowledge could be freely shared among our populace — Education4All!</p>
